"""Classify repository names against `contracts/repository-naming.yaml`.

USAGE
    validate-repository-naming.py NAME [NAME ...]
    validate-repository-naming.py --project project.yaml
    printf '%s\\n' openChart MedxChart | validate-repository-naming.py
    validate-repository-naming.py --explain openxFactory
    validate-repository-naming.py --explain --role assembly MedxScribe
    validate-repository-naming.py --pins openChart --explain MedxChart
    validate-repository-naming.py --pins openXdox \\
        --referent-chain openXdox,openDox --explain codexDox

A NAME may be given bare (`openChart`) or fully qualified (`opensoft/openChart`);
only the part after the last `/` is classified, because the organisation login
is not part of any family.

WHAT `--role` AND `--pins` ARE FOR. A name in `<Domainx><Product>` form is a
CLAIM of descent, and since the 2026-09-02 ruling a claim needs a REFERENT: it
classifies as a domain descendant only when the project declares a pin on the
matching `open<Product>`. `--pins` supplies those declarations for a one-off
check and `--role` supplies the role the project would declare, so a name can
be classified here on exactly the facts `project.yaml` would carry. With
`--project` both are READ from the manifest instead — the legs' roles, and
`neutral_product_pins:` — which is what the scaffolded project's own gate runs.

`--role` IS ALSO WHAT ASKS WHETHER AN ELECTED FORM CARRIES ITS ROLE. Since
2026-09-05 a neutral product may ELECT the shape and be its own assembly root,
so `--explain --role assembly openDox` answers `neutral-product / assembly`
and names the admission, while `--explain openDox` — nothing declared — answers
`neutral-product` as it always did. The form is never overridden by the
declaration; the role is ADDED to it, and the leg form it also satisfies stays
in `also_matches`.

ONLY A FORM THAT NEEDS A DECLARATION IS A `--role` VALUE. `family` is one,
because the holder form is declared-only and the characters cannot tell you.
`workspace` is not, for the same reason `install` and `neutral-product` are
not: `<user>-wip` is unambiguous by construction, so there is nothing to
declare and `--role workspace` is refused as the unknown choice it is. A role
that IS a choice, declared over such a name, is ignored rather than carried —
`--role assembly brett-wip` answers `workspace`, exactly as it does for
`<X>-Install`.

WHAT `--referent-chain` AND `--link-source` ARE FOR. Since 2026-09-05 the
referent may be reached through a CHAIN of neutral-product pins: `codexDox`
pins `openXdox`, and `openXdox` pins `openDox`. The chain is RECORDED, in the
descendant's own manifest under `naming.referent_chain:` (which `--project`
reads); `--referent-chain openXdox,openDox` supplies the same record for a
one-off check. Every link beyond the first is a declaration in ANOTHER tree,
and `--link-source [PRODUCT=]PATH` — like `SHAPE_PIN_SOURCE_<PRODUCT>` and a
checkout sitting beside the project — says where that tree is. A link no
source answers for is reported as `declared-unverified` and the name STILL
classifies as a descendant: the check is offline, and a recorded declaration
is the fact it reads.

EXIT CODES, the same three in every validator this standard ships:
    0  every name classified (and, with `--project`, every declared role and
       the topic agreed with the classification)
    1  a FINDING: at least one name matches no family, or a leg's declared role
       disagrees with the form of its name
    2  a REFUSAL: the question could not be asked at all — the policy file is
       missing, unparsable, or not a naming policy

A chain link whose tree could not be read prints a WARNING and changes no exit
code, deliberately: see `--link-source` below.

The 1/2 split is deliberate. "This name is wrong" and "I could not read the
policy" are different facts and a gate that renders them identically invites a
workflow that treats the second as the first.
