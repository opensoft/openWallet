"""Validate this project's `project.yaml` — the SOURCE of the group.

`project.yaml` is the self-describing manifest of a project that has elected
the three-repository shape. It is the SOURCE and an aggregation's
`project-register.yaml` row is DERIVED from it, never the other way round —
which is the only construction that works for an organisation that has no
aggregation and no register at all. A register that disagrees with a manifest
is register drift, not manifest drift.

IT CONFERS NOTHING. `schema:`, `legs[].role` and the topic are descriptive
navigation. No field here grants review authority, clearance eligibility, gate
standing or lifecycle state over any repository it names; authority travels in
grants, and a one-repository project is reviewed identically to this one.

WHAT IS CHECKED
  - the envelope: `schema_version`, `kind`, `id`, `name`, `schema`
  - `elected_by` / `elected_on`, because an election with no elector and no
    date is not an election
  - `topic` equals `xf-project-<id>` derived from the id
  - `shape`: a commit-and-digest pin of the openRepoShape revision this
    project was scaffolded from, `revision_kind: commit`, never a tag
  - `legs`: EXACTLY the roles {assembly, spec, code}, once each, all in one
    organisation, at distinct relative paths, with the assembly leg at `.`
  - every leg's repository name against `contracts/repository-naming.yaml`,
    and the classified form against the declared role. THREE forms may be an
    assembly root: the bare project-leg form; since 2026-09-02 a DECLARED
    domain descendant, because a descendant may carry legs (`MedxGlass` pins
    `openGlass` and still mounts `MedxGlass-spec` and `MedxGlass-code`); and
    since 2026-09-05 a NEUTRAL PRODUCT that has elected the shape (`openDox`
    mounts `openDox-spec` and `openDox-code`). The pin is what admits the
    second, so the refusal for `referent_declared: true` with no pin file
    beside it stands unchanged; the policy's `admits_declared_role:` is what
    admits the third, and the form still wins, so such a leg records
    `form: neutral-product, role: assembly` with the leg form in
    `also_matches`. None of the three may be the spec or code leg, and an
    `<X>-Install` may be no leg at all.
  - each leg's OPTIONAL `naming:` record — that `form` and `role` are the
    classification the policy actually returns for that name given what this
    manifest declares, that `also_matches` lists every other form the name
    satisfies, and that `referent_declared: true` has the pin file to show for
    it. A `<Domainx><Product>` name is a domain descendant only when the
    matching `open<Product>` is REACHED: pinned directly in
    `neutral_product_pins:` (2026-09-02: a claim needs a referent), or reached
    through the pin chain this leg records in `naming.referent_chain:`
    (2026-09-05: `codexDox` pins `openXdox`, `openXdox` pins `openDox`), with
    `contracts/<the pin this project holds>-pin.yaml` in the tree either way.
    A link of the chain is VERIFIED against that link's own manifest when its
    tree is beside this root, and reported as `declared-unverified` — a
    WARNING, not a finding — when it is not. The whole check is OFFLINE.
