# openWallet

The ASSEMBLY ROOT of the `openwallet` project — the repository you clone.
It holds no product code of its own: it holds the manifest that says what this
project IS, the two legs as submodules, and the pins that say which commit of
each leg this project is.

Scaffolded from [opensoft/openRepoShape](https://github.com/opensoft/openRepoShape)
at `7f84ca42ca86a8902928345109d2bf6bad87bd91`. Elected by Brett Heap on 2026-10-08, against
`openxFactory docs/project-repo-schema.md`.

## What openWallet is

openWallet is the neutral wallet standard: two contract families, the packaged
corpus, the conformance validator, the syntax gate and the promoted
requirements, carrying no openxFactory input. It is a product that other
repositories pin.
[opensoft/openXwallet](https://github.com/opensoft/openXwallet), where it was
built, becomes the openxFactory adapter that pins it.

**Status: carved** (2026-10-08, task 4.5 of openXwallet's
`split-openwallet-neutral-core`). The content arrived from opensoft/openXwallet
at `90111df262d6f54f7e82651d860adc12345f83f4`. openXwallet's
`docs/openwallet-carve-manifest.yaml` declares every path that moves, byte for
byte. The procedure, with a rollback written before every phase, is
[`docs/openwallet-cutover-runbook.md`](docs/openwallet-cutover-runbook.md).
This root holds the scaffold, that runbook, `.specify/`, the agent instructions
and the ten carved `openwallet_root` rows. The first release, `wallet-v1.6`, is
tagged on `b0af7c2ce53d63786a08a20aa3602a6f90345606` (opensoft/openWallet#7).
At that commit both pins and both gitlinks name `spec` at
`1924500354f472a6298c02db44a3ae2b21b8908e` (the archive merge of
opensoft/openWallet-spec#4, after the spec leg's carve merge `15c15bbd`) and
`code` at `72313daab1f229c049cb90998931564c1904dbbc` (the code leg's carve
merge), and the manifest's eight owned rows point at `code/contracts/…`.

### What each repository owns after the split

| repository | owns |
|---|---|
| `opensoft/openWallet` (this root) | `project.yaml`; the pins; the release identity (`contracts/manifest.yaml`, `contracts/CHANGELOG.md`, `contracts/releases/` and the `wallet-v*` tag); the proof; `LICENSE`; `.specify/` |
| `opensoft/openWallet-spec` | the promoted `openxwallet` and `openxwallet-agent-profile` specs, their archives, the travelling change `add-composition-drift-cascade`, Speckit features 006, 010 and 015, and its own OpenSpec gate |
| `opensoft/openWallet-code` | both contract families, the corpus, the validator, the syntax gate, their tests, and the `wallet-validation` and `pytest-suite` checks, which run from INSIDE the leg |

The contracts sit in the code leg, beside the validator that reads them. That
is a declared override of the shape's default, ruled by Brett Heap as Q7. See
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

### Pinning openWallet

Consumers pin THIS ROOT by commit and digest, never a leg. They verify the code
leg through the root's lockstep. Inside a consumer, a code-leg path `P` is
`openWallet/code/P`, and its sha256 is the same at every depth. Domain
descendants pin a version and carry a profile. They never fork.

### Gates

Every gate is offline.

| repository | check |
|---|---|
| this root | `validate`: names, manifest and lockstep pins |
| spec leg | `openspec-cli-pin`: strict OpenSpec validation through a CLI installed from a tarball committed in that leg |
| code leg | `wallet-validation` and `pytest-suite` |

A wallet validator run from this root prunes both legs and scans nothing. It is
never a gate.

## Get started

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/opensoft/openWallet.git
cd openWallet
make bootstrap
```

`make bootstrap` puts each leg on the `main` branch **at its
pinned commit** (so you are not staring at a detached HEAD), runs the three
neutral validators, and prints whatever review authority a wallet register
names for this project — or says plainly that authority is not wallet-carried
here, and continues.

### Parking work for another workstation

Unfinished work moves between machines as a RECORD, not as a folder:

```sh
make park                  # before you leave this workstation
# on the next one:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/opensoft/openWallet.git
cd openWallet && make bootstrap && make resume
```

`make park` commits and pushes every open feature worktree and records what
it parked; `make resume` recreates those worktrees here and un-commits the
work, leaving it in your tree as you left it. `ARGS=--dry-run` rehearses
either one and writes nothing. The mechanics are the Speckit git extension's
— `setup-openspeckit` installs it, and both targets refuse by name when it is
missing — and `resume` REFUSES a feature whose branch has moved since the
park rather than resetting over somebody else's commit. Nothing under
`worktrees/` is ever committed, pushed or synced, on either side.

## The three legs

| role | repository | path | holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| assembly | `opensoft/openWallet` | `.` | this manifest, the pins, the gate |
| spec | `opensoft/openWallet-spec` | `spec/` | requirements, decisions, acceptance |
| code | `opensoft/openWallet-code` | `code/` | the implementation and its tests |

All three carry the GitHub topic `xf-project-openwallet`, so the organisation's own search
surfaces the group without a checkout.

## Reading private legs in CI: a GitHub App first, `SHAPE_LEGS_TOKEN` as fallback

If `opensoft/openWallet-spec` or `opensoft/openWallet-code` is **private or internal**,
the `validate` workflow's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot clone it as a
submodule.

Preferred: a dedicated GitHub App — permissions **Contents: Read-only** and
**Metadata: Read**, installed on this organisation with access to the legs —
mints a short-lived token at run time:

```sh
gh secret set SHAPE_LEGS_APP_ID --org <your-org> --body '<app id>'
gh secret set SHAPE_LEGS_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --org <your-org> < app-private-key.pem
```

Fallback: a fine-grained **`SHAPE_LEGS_TOKEN`** PAT, `contents:read` on the
LEGS ONLY:

```sh
gh secret set SHAPE_LEGS_TOKEN --org <your-org> --body '<token>'
```

**On the GitHub Free plan, set these as REPOSITORY secrets.** GitHub delivers
an ORGANISATION secret only to PUBLIC repositories on Free, so on a private
repository `secrets.SHAPE_LEGS_APP_ID` is the empty string — silently — the
App steps skip, and `validate` goes GREEN with the lockstep pin check degraded
away rather than red. Use `--repo <org>/<Repo>` in place of `--org <your-org>`
above, or upgrade the organisation to Team. (Measured on InkRouter,
2026-09-04.)

The root repository itself is always readable by the workflow's own default
token, so `actions/checkout` never carries a `token:` override — putting a
legs-scoped credential there instead is what broke the ROOT checkout with a
403 the first time a PAT was tried for real. Whichever credential resolves is
read only inside the guarded "fetch the legs (submodules)" step, scoped to
that step's `env:`, and used through a `git -c url.<...>.insteadOf=<...>`
rewrite covering both HTTPS and SSH leg URLs — it never touches the root
checkout.

`validate` tries the App first — a `mint a leg-reader token from the GitHub
App` step, scoped by `repositories:` to the legs this organisation itself
owns (a leg under a different owner is excluded with a warning, since an
installation token is per-owner) — and falls back to `SHAPE_LEGS_TOKEN` when
the App is not configured. A configured App that fails to mint fails the job
outright, naming both secrets and the required installation, rather than
degrading.

Without either credential the workflow does not go red on that account: it
checks out the root without submodules, tries `git submodule update --init
--recursive` best-effort, and — if that fails — still runs the naming and
manifest checks, skips `validate-pins.py` with a warning explaining why, and
only fails outright if a credential (App or PAT) **is** configured and the
fetch still failed — naming which source it used. That presence check reads
job-level `env: SHAPE_LEGS_APP_SET` / `SHAPE_LEGS_TOKEN_SET` booleans rather
than the `secrets` context directly in the step's `if:` — the `secrets`
context is not allowed in a step-level `if:` expression, and using it there
makes GitHub reject the whole workflow file instead of just that step.

## The lockstep invariant

For each leg, THREE things name the same commit and they move in ONE commit:

1. the **gitlink** — the `160000` entry recorded at the leg's path
2. **`commit:`** in `contracts/<role>-pin.yaml`
3. every **`.github/workflows/*.yml` `@<sha>`** reference naming that leg

`python3 scripts/validate-pins.py` (also `make pins`, also the `validate` check
on every pull request) refuses if they disagree, and recomputes the leg's tree
digest on top. Advancing a pin is therefore one commit that touches the
submodule, the pin file, and any workflow ref — never a bare `git submodule
update` followed by a commit.

This is written down because the family learned it the expensive way: seven
consecutive pin-syncs in the xFactory aggregation moved the gitlink alone and
left `validate` red on every pull request for a day, unnoticed because the
check runs on pull requests only.

## What the election confers

Nothing. Electing this shape changes no gate, no floor, no grant and no
clearance eligibility; a one-repository project is reviewed identically,
because the authority travels in the grants rather than in the layout. The
`role:` fields in `project.yaml` are navigation. A tool that reads `role: spec`
as "spec authority lives here" has quietly turned a layout into a governance
boundary, and is defective.
